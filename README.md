1. Display: We now use both digits of the 7-segment display.
2. Keypad Input: The program reads input from the TEC-1's keypad using port #F800.
3. Game Logic: 
   - It's a simple "Space Game" where the player needs to hit the correct key when shown on the 7-segment display.
   - The game generates a random target (displayed on the terminal in hex) and then shows a random number on the 7-segment display.
   - The player needs to press the correct key (0-F) to match the displayed number.
   - Pressing 'F' skips the current round.
   - The game keeps track of the score over 10 rounds.
4. Sound: We use beeps to indicate correct answers and button presses.
5. Menu System: The program now has a main menu where the player can choose to play or view instructions.
6. Random Number Generation: We implement a simple pseudo-random number generator using the remainder of the last operation.

 



### v2 st2.md
 update the game based on this image and gameplay

 

```
The stardate is 1732. You are the captain of the USS Enterprise.  You have received word from Starfleet
command of a plot by Klingon spies to destroy all the Federation starbases in the region so the
Klingon Empire can assume control. The Federation is in danger and you are the only ship in range.
Your mission is to hunt down and destroy the 10 Klingon warships in the region. You must complete
your mission before stardate 1763, giving you 31 stardates to succeed. There are 2 Federation Starbases
in the region for refueling, restocking torpedoes, and repairs. Check the ship's computer to access the
captain's manual for a tutorial on how to complete your mission. Good luck, galactic peace is in your hands!
=============================
As you begin your mission, you find yourself in a sector clear of enemy ships.  You will have to use
navigation to jump to another sector to engage with the enemy. If the sectors adjacent to your ship
are unexplored, you can use your long range sensors to try and find the enemy.
```

Certainly! I'll update the game based on the image you've provided, which appears to be a Star Trek-inspired space combat game. Let's modify our MINT program to incorporate these new elements and gameplay features.



This updated program incorporates many features from the Star Trek game shown in the image:

1. Game State: We now track sector and subsector coordinates, stardates, Klingons, starbases, torpedoes, and energy.

2. Display Functions:
   - `D`: Displays game stats similar to the right side of the image.
   - `M`: Displays a simple sector map (without actual ship placements for simplicity).

3. Navigation: The `N` function allows the player to enter new sector coordinates, simulating movement.

4. Main Game Loop: The `G` function presents a menu similar to the one in the image, allowing the player to choose different actions.

5. 7-Segment Display: Used to show the current subsector coordinates.

6. Game Flow: The game starts with instructions and continues until either the player runs out of stardates or destroys all Klingons.

To use this program on your TEC-1:

1. Load the MINT interpreter onto your TEC-1.
2. Enter this program into MINT.
3. Run the program by typing `I` and pressing Enter to start the game with instructions.

This version provides a basic framework for the Star Trek game. Due to the limitations of the TEC-1 and MINT, some features are simplified:

- The sector map doesn't show actual ship positions.
- Weapons, shield control, sensors, and ship's computer functions are placeholders.
- Random events and actual combat are not implemented.

To fully replicate the game in the image, you'd need to expand on this framework, adding more detailed map rendering, implementing the missing functions, and creating a more complex game state. However, this version captures the essence of the game and demonstrates how you could start building such a game on the TEC-1 platform.

Remember to adjust timings and display methods as needed to suit your specific TEC-1 setup. The game heavily relies on terminal output, so ensure your TEC-1 is properly connected to a terminal for the best experience.
