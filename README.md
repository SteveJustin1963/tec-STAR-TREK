```
The stardate is 1732. You are the captain of the USS Enterprise.  You have received word from Starfleet
command of a plot by Klingon spies to destroy all the Federation starbases in the region so the
Klingon Empire can assume control. The Federation is in danger and you are the only ship in range.
Your mission is to hunt down and destroy the 10 Klingon warships in the region. You must complete
your mission before stardate 1763, giving you 31 stardates to succeed. There are 2 Federation Starbases
in the region for refueling, restocking torpedoes, and repairs. Check the ship's computer to access the
captain's manual for a tutorial on how to complete your mission. Good luck, galactic peace is in your hands!
=============================
As you begin your mission, you find yourself in a sector clear of enemy ships.  You will have to use
navigation to jump to another sector to engage with the enemy. If the sectors adjacent to your ship
are unexplored, you can use your long range sensors to try and find the enemy.
